#QuantuMoonLight

QuantuMoonLight is a user-friendly web platform aimed at quantum computation and machine learning enthusiasts, industry professionals, students and researchers.

The main function of the system is to allow registered users to perform common operation as validation, preprocessing and classifications on datasets uploaded by users.

Quantum Machine Learning is a little known area and therefore we want to extend the community interested, trying to offer a product simple, reliable and useful, using the solutions made available by new Quantum Computing technologies.

The goal of the project is to observe the variation of the metrics of a quantum classification algorithm by applying preprocessing techniques that decrease the dimensionality of a dataset in favor of execution time.

The purpose of this project is to present, in detail, the algorithms of the Machine Learning pipeline algorithms used in the QML platform: from validation and feature engineering methods to the creation and use of the quantum classification model.
